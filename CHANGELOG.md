## 2025-03-26 Schema proposal checks now WARN on missing description changes instead of ERROR
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| Schema proposal checks now WARN instead of ERROR for descriptions that do not have a matching approved schema proposal. This means copy and white space mismatches in descriptions will no longer block these checks. | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1fdfba0-dfa7-4a6c-9049-d93e23f1e52c)


## 2025-02-05 Happy new year! 🥳
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| Schema proposal checks now show more granular results when you open the matching proposals drawer for a given line. This makes it easier to identify which change is causing your check to fail and why. | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcbb659b-22b8-4840-8ae5-f03e890f8f9b)
