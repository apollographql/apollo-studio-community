| :--------- |
| üö¶ MORE BREAKING CHANGES IN CHECKS.  Schema checks now detect breaking changes in more cases, such as for enum values, interface fields, and union fields on a list. In addition, schema checks on operations will now fail if there are potentially breaking schema changes and there is no recorded operation traffic in Studio to check against. For Schema Checks to be able to properly assess the level of impact, observed traffic must exist to determine if a change is actually affecting any operations. [Learn more in the schema checks docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-checks/#the-check-response).

## 2022-10-21 Offline Sandbox now only accessible in embedded contexts
| What's new | 
| :--------- |
| In order to provide more timely updates to Studio users, offline support for Sandbox will only be accessible from embedded contexts, and studio.apollographql.com/sandbox will no longer remain accessible while not connected to internet. [Apollo Server 4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/server) renders an embedded Sandbox by default. Apollo Server 3 users can opt-in to embedding Sandbox in its landing page by [setting the landing page plugin's config to `embed: true`](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/tooling/graphql-ide/how-to-use-apollo-sandbox-on-your-localhost/#embed-sandbox-by-default-for-apollo-server). Sandbox can also be embedded on any page via the [`@apollo/sandbox` package](https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer/tree/main/packages/sandbox).

## 2022-10-05 Announcing the Apollo GraphOS public platform API
| What's new | 
| :--------- |
| As of today, [you can now use our new public API](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/tooling/devtools/integrate-with-graphos-using-the-new-platform-api/) to integrate with the Apollo GraphOS platform. We built this API to enable those using GraphOS to easily automate operations in their own systems and CI workflows. See the [API‚Äôs readme](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-platform/home?variant=main) to get started, and check out the operation collections in Explorer to see example GraphQL queries and mutations you can use for your own graphs.

| When filtering schema, you can now AND within the same filter type with **syntax separated by space**. For the same filter type, if you use commma and space separators, both, then you can filter by a combination of AND / OR. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Please note that this enhancement only works when you enter the filter query manually and not through the filter dropdown.| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86634858/189383897-b17c3755-2663-484f-a7cd-90b68e02ef06.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86634858/189384333-f9ab6ba9-2d14-42c7-b72c-5993a56287cc.png)

## 2022-09-08 Contract Checks! 
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| We have introduced checks for contracts! Each contract check run includes a build task and an operation task. This latest release will ensure that no contract (downstream) variants are affected by changes made to the source variant‚Äôs subgraphs or by changes made to the contract filtering configuration.|

## 2022-08-01 
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| We have made some improvements to the Trace View for operations.  We now show an accurate gap in the timing between when the gateway / router sends a request and when the subgraph starts processing it. We also show a warning and adjust the timings if the subgraph reported times are out of range of the gateway reported times, which can happen if the subgraph is using a different clock.  As an added aesthetic improvement, subgraphs are now displayed with an icon in the trace instead of using the `subgraph:` prefix. | ![Screen Shot 2022-08-02 at 2 43 29 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1110099/182294213-0f7ecc02-5d4b-47f3-8dd3-1b30091dfe47.png)


## 2022-07-28 Schema Reference Filtering ü•≥
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| You can now filter Schema Reference on subgraphs, directives, tags, arguments and return types - AND across multiple filter types, OR within a single filter type. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86634858/182259987-5e816d88-f31b-4d5a-83fd-172a5bf69718.png) |

## 2022-07-12
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| You can now configure whether to pass `@tag` directives defined in your subgraphs through to consumers in Schema Reference and Explorer. These tags can help your API's consumers better understand your schema. To enable tags to pass through, update the build configuration for your variant. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2107126/178511185-fba66590-6129-4dd3-a7a7-e09242204cc3.png)

## 2022-02-16
We've shipped some recent upgrades to Operation Insights in Apollo Studio. This update features three significant enhancements which make it easier to understand the usage and data flow of operations in your graph. [See the complete blogpost here.](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/platform/new-operation-insights-with-client-usage-and-federation-query-plans/)

| What's new | |
| :--- | ---- |
| First, we brought the operation signature front and center so that you can quickly understand the shape of fields being requested by the operation. The signature now appears as a side-panel that you can resize instead of hidden behind another tab. | ![image](https://wp.apollographql.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/operation-blog-1-1024x621.png) |
| In the same panel, we added the ability to view the federation query plan for an operation. The query plan lets you see how Apollo Gateway or Router is working under the hood, describing how data from your subgraphs is woven together to build a full query response. | ![image](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/static/0ad0380c2fe95a1267a5e0f752f60701/operation-blog-2.png) |
| Last but not least, we introduced a way to understand which clients are using an operation in a new Client Usage display. The most active clients are sorted to the top of the list based on the number of requests reported to Apollo Studio via usage reporting. | ![image](https://wp.apollographql.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/operation-blog-3-1024x621.png) |

## 2022-02-15
| What's new | |
| :--- | ---- |
| We have added support for using subgraphs in Sandbox! If the endpoint that you add to Sandbox points to a subgraph, a SUBGRAPH badge will appear. |![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14367451/154155677-b83f2f30-7291-41d0-b1d7-f083f5b8866d.png) |
| You can then run operations against your local subgraph schema, diff your changes against a registered subgraph schema and run checks to ensure that your changes do not affect composition or any running operations to the corresponding federated graph. Learn more [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/sandbox/#subgraph-checks). | ![subgraph-sandbox-one-check-failed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14367451/154148356-2fabcd82-1124-4a3b-bd70-5820e33f7895.jpg)|

| Preflight scripts now expose the graphql POST request body and the crypto-js project. You can use the request body by referencing `explorer.request.body`, and crypto-js can be accessed with `explorer.CryptoJS` | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3953093/152077068-7d2c9dc8-4c13-464f-960d-1e8bc38c5991.png) | 

## 2022-01-25
| What's new | |
| :-- | --- |
| Operation names can now be excluded from schema checks. Sometimes an operation ID is not enough to prevent failures while checking schemas, and to ignore expected failures on certain operations, we've introduced the ability to exclude operations by name from the Checks Config page. | ![Excluded Operation Names](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/639025/151235036-cc195e6a-480f-4cf0-a05f-ca44df4cec4d.gif) | 

## 2022-01-11

| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| We've updated the Graph Settings to be spread out across 5 tabs.
