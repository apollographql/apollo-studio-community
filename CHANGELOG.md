| Since the release of public preview we have been working hard to improve the overall quality of life for Contracts. With GA you‚Äôll find some fresh and nifty tools like the filter preview that allows you to view the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù contract schema when you apply your filter configurations, support for tagging **additional schema elements** with Federation 2, the ability to view downstream contract launches via the Launches page, and many bug fixes! | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10705986/167470093-bdcc56e9-1fdb-4a5c-9c5f-012f483e015a.png) |

| We've updated the new graph on-boarding experience to have a fresh new look, and now federation 2 is the default on-boarding experience. There is no impact to existing graphs with this update. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6365997/162784055-ec577ae6-18ff-4719-b1e1-3602362198e2.png) |
| You are now prompted to select a default build pipeline track for your graph during on-boarding. All new variants will use this track by default. Individual variants can still override the graph-level default in the variant settings page. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6365997/162784409-f42b48b9-a521-4f9f-a2e8-07e3380a723d.png) |

We've shipped some recent upgrades to Operation Insights in Apollo Studio. This update features three significant enhancements which make it easier to understand the usage and data flow of operations in your graph. [See the complete blogpost here.](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/platform/new-operation-insights-with-client-usage-and-federation-query-plans/)

| What's new | |
| :--- | ---- |
| First, we brought the operation signature front and center so that you can quickly understand the shape of fields being requested by the operation. The signature now appears as a side-panel that you can resize instead of hidden behind another tab. | ![image](https://wp.apollographql.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/operation-blog-1-1024x621.png) |
| In the same panel, we added the ability to view the federation query plan for an operation. The query plan lets you see how Apollo Gateway or Router is working under the hood, describing how data from your subgraphs is woven together to build a full query response. | ![image](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/static/0ad0380c2fe95a1267a5e0f752f60701/operation-blog-2.png) |
| Last but not least, we introduced a way to understand which clients are using an operation in a new Client Usage display. The most active clients are sorted to the top of the list based on the number of requests reported to Apollo Studio via usage reporting. | ![image](https://wp.apollographql.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/operation-blog-3-1024x621.png) |

| We have added support for using subgraphs in Sandbox! If the endpoint that you add to Sandbox points to a subgraph, a SUBGRAPH badge will appear. |![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14367451/154155677-b83f2f30-7291-41d0-b1d7-f083f5b8866d.png) |
| You can then run operations against your local subgraph schema, diff your changes against a registered subgraph schema and run checks to ensure that your changes do not affect composition or any running operations to the corresponding federated graph. Learn more [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/sandbox/#subgraph-checks). | ![subgraph-sandbox-one-check-failed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14367451/154148356-2fabcd82-1124-4a3b-bd70-5820e33f7895.jpg)|

| Preflight scripts now expose the graphql POST request body and the crypto-js project. You can use the request body by referencing `explorer.request.body`, and crypto-js can be accessed with `explorer.CryptoJS` | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3953093/152077068-7d2c9dc8-4c13-464f-960d-1e8bc38c5991.png) |

| Operation names can now be excluded from schema checks. Sometimes an operation ID is not enough to prevent failures while checking schemas, and to ignore expected failures on certain operations, we've introduced the ability to exclude operations by name from the Checks Config page. | ![Excluded Operation Names](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/639025/151235036-cc195e6a-480f-4cf0-a05f-ca44df4cec4d.gif) |

| We've updated the Graph Settings to be spread out across 5 tabs. We previously had just **General** and **Access**, and now we have **General**, **Permissions**, **API Keys**, **Reporting**, and **Variants**. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/149028499-df4239ab-163e-4d6b-bc25-17a46e8dd66b.png) |

| Preflight scripts are now available in Explorer! Preflight scripts are really useful for managing authentication before operations are run. As graph producers, you can automate authentication against your graph endpoints to reduce friction for your graph consumers as much as possible, increasing graph usage and adoption. Simply click to add the code snippets and get started with your preflight scripts today! For details, see [docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/connecting-authenticating/#preflight-scripts).| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86634858/147967983-7573674b-cdb8-4d37-8879-375cf771c54a.png) |
