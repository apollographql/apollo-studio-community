| :-- | :-: |
| We have made embedding Explorer MUCH easier! With our first release, you had to read and understand the full documentation and copy a volume of code in order to get started. But now you can just generate the code in a few clicks. Head over to Explorer for any public graph, and under Explorer Settings, find **Embed Explorer**. Toggle on/off options as you like, use the operation in your editor as the default and copy the code snippet to paste - that is it!! Embed Explorer to enable consumers to test out the graph from your own website, blog posts, documentation, etc. using the amazing Explorer experience.

## 2021-03-04
| Security Upgrade |
| :--------------- |
| We have made a change to the way you use API keys with Studio: API keys are no longer be visible in plain text in your Graph and User Settings pages. You will only be able to see your API key secret in the moment that you first create it in Studio. This is security change we have made to reduce the probability of keys being accidentally leaked from our system. If you need to recover a token you have previously created, you can request help from us at support@apollographql.com. We recommend you just make a new token though. All existing keys will continue to work as-is, and no action is necessary as part of this change. |

| What's new |
| :--------- |

| üêõ Bug fix |
| :--------- |
| We have fixed a **(very)** long-standing bug with our GitHub logins. Previously, if you changed your GitHub username and tried to log in to Studio again, you‚Äôd end up with a brand new unrelated account. (Also if your username was somebody else‚Äôs ‚Äúold username‚Äù who had logged in to Studio from GH with that username, you were locked out of using Studio entirely.) We‚Äôve fixed this: you can change your GitHub username as much as you want and you can still log in.|

| We've enhanced the [user roles system](https://apollographql.com/docs/studio/org/members/) available to Enterprise customers! <ul><li>Users can be granted a **role on a specific graph** with more permissions than their organization-level role.</li><li>A graph can be **hidden** from non-Organization Admin users that have not been explicitly granted a role on that graph.</li><li>Each [**graph API key**](https://apollographql.com/docs/studio/api-keys/#setting-permissions) now has a role (Graph Admin, Contributor, Observer, or Consumer) which limits their permissions. (Existing graph API keys retain their existing permissions.)</li><li>A new **Graph Admin** role has complete control over graphs (including managing graph-specific roles) but no organization-level administrative permissions. Existing Contributors have been changed to this role.</li><li>The Contributor role now is very similar to the Observer role, plus the ability to push new versions of the graph's schema. You can now mark individual variants as **protected**; you need to be a **Graph Admin** to push schemas to these variants.</li></ul> | <img width="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16724/105080845-406c9300-5a46-11eb-8c22-94122e4a5a93.png"> |

| You can now hard delete organizations on your organization's **Settings** page. Previously, you needed to contact Apollo support to do this. When you hard delete an organization, the following things will happen:<ul><li>If your organization is on a Team plan or Team trial, your subscription willl be immediately canceled. We can't issue refunds for this unfortunately.</li><li>All users memberships in your organization will be removed. Users of your organization will maintain their user accounts, but they will no longer be members of your org.</li><li>All graphs in your organization will be hard deleted. To keep your data secure, their graph IDs will be tombstoned and you will not be able to create new graphs with the same ID in the future.</li></ul>| <img width="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/104364461-76040000-54cb-11eb-929f-7bf935128f39.png"> |

| You can now mock data from your operations in the Explorer with the "Mock responses" option in the Explorer's settings. This will return naively mocked data rather than sending requests to your endpoint. This is useful if you need to generate test data or if you want to try out queries without having and endpoint to send to. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/97745141-a11eac00-1aa5-11eb-9a47-c9f8a2037ce2.png) |

| Building off of recent updates to schema checks, you can now rerun checks from inside Studio. When you rerun a check, the latest check configuration is applied. The new check uses an updated time window for operations ‚Äî in addition, any changes made to excluded / included clients, checked variants, and any operations already marked safe / ignored are incorporated when rerunning. If you are using the Github Action to trigger checks, a rerun of the check also updates the status of the check in Github. | ![Rerun Checks Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1831709/97130183-c30deb00-1794-11eb-8b03-a79818ac78db.png) |

## 2020-10-02
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| The [Datadog integration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/datadog-integration/) now sends metrics that start with `apollo.operations` instead of `apollo.engine.operations` and tags them with `graph:` rather than `service:`, to match our current naming scheme. This change affects newly configured Datadog integrations only. Graphs currently sending metrics to Datadog continue to use the old names; you can change to use the new names by clicking "Transition to modern mode" on your graph's Integrations page. |

## 2020-09-24
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| Federation: you can now see composition errors on implementing services published to your variant. You can see these composition errors, if present, by clicking on the "services" tab of the variant in question. |

## 2020-09-23
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| Creating new graphs with the Apollo Server integration is now simpler. Running your server with the `APOLLO_KEY` and
  `APOLLO_SCHEMA_REPORTING` environment variables will now automatically report metrics and schema to Studio, with no configuration in `ApolloServer` itself necessary. |

## 2020-09-16
- Studio welcomes a new and improved check details page, featuring...
  - Request usage graphs of affected operations
  - Differentiation between operations that are broken vs. changing behavior

| We'll make a best guess at reconstructing any unrecognized directives, so schemas that don't include definitions for directives should no longer crash the Schema or Explorer pages. | |
| Improved experience for path selection in Explorer page's search | |
| You can now favorite graph variants, which will pin the variant to the top of the graphs list page. Favorited variants are saved to your individual account, so you'll be able to see them when logging in on a new device. To favorite a graph, hover over your desired variant on the graph list page, and click the star icon on the left side. | ![favorite-graphs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8431868/91739780-64573700-eb80-11ea-8073-4d66d0f0c443.gif) |
