## 2021-03-04
| Security Upgrade |
| :--------------- |
| We have made a change to the way you use API keys with Studio: API keys are no longer be visible in plain text in your Graph and User Settings pages. You will only be able to see your API key secret in the moment that you first create it in Studio. This is security change we have made to reduce the probability of keys being accidentally leaked from our system. If you need to recover a token you have previously created, you can request help from us at support@apollographql.com. We recommend you just make a new token though. All existing keys will continue to work as-is, and no action is necessary as part of this change. |

## 2021-02-26
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| Community and Team plans can now assign users [the Billing Manager role](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles), in addition to the default Org Admin role. You can change this on your organization's membership page. |

## 2021-02-18
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| We added a feature to introduce Dev Graphs. If you have opened a Dev Graph recently you may see an informative popup! | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14367451/108418344-f6620300-71e5-11eb-804c-229cf2793651.png) |

## 2021-02-17
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| We make a performance improvement to the Operations page; it should no longer slow down dramatically and/or become unresponsive when your graph has a very large number of clients. |

## 2021-02-15
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| üö• We shipped a small change to how Development Graphs poll their status so that they‚Äôre no longer polling for connectivity status on the Graph List page. When you're using a Dev Graph, you can also turn off its polling with the controls in the global nav. |

## 2021-02-08
| Security Upgrade |
| :--------- |
| We are upgrading our minimum TLS version to 1.2 for communications with our APIs. This is being done as 1.1 has largely been deprecated industry wide for some time now, and our client's security is a top concern for us. For more information, please see our [StatusPage maintenance notice here](https://status.apollographql.com/incidents/chgzx4ppw5z9) |

| What's new |
| :--------- |
| We've added **Schema Change Webhooks** ![webhooks icon](https://studio-staging.apollographql.com/icons/webhook.svg) for our Enterprise customers! We also updated Studio to remove the *Integrations* section and integrate it into *Settings*.<ul><li>You can now find Datadog settings under *Settings > General*.</li><li>Notification integrations including PagerDuty, Slack, and now Webhooks for Enterprise customers can be found under *Settings > Notifications*.</li><li>To setup a webhook for schema changes click *Add Notification*, select *Schema Change*, select the Variant you're interested in, *Create new channel*, *Webhook*.</li><li>Schema Change Webhooks will contain a string description of the schema change as well as a temporary URL which you can use to fetch the full updated schema.

## 2021-01-28
| üêõ Bug fix |
| :--------- |
| We have fixed a **(very)** long-standing bug with our GitHub logins. Previously, if you changed your GitHub username and tried to log in to Studio again, you‚Äôd end up with a brand new unrelated account. (Also if your username was somebody else‚Äôs ‚Äúold username‚Äù who had logged in to Studio from GH with that username, you were locked out of using Studio entirely.) We‚Äôve fixed this: you can change your GitHub username as much as you want and you can still log in.|

| We've enhanced the [user roles system](https://apollographql.com/docs/studio/org/members/) available to Enterprise customers! <ul><li>Users can be granted a **role on a specific graph** with more permissions than their organization-level role.</li><li>A graph can be **hidden** from non-Organization Admin users that have not been explicitly granted a role on that graph.</li><li>Each [**graph API key**](https://apollographql.com/docs/studio/api-keys/#setting-permissions) now has a role (Graph Admin, Contributor, Observer, or Consumer) which limits their permissions. (Existing graph API keys retain their existing permissions.)</li><li>A new **Graph Admin** role has complete control over graphs (including managing graph-specific roles) but no organization-level administrative permissions. Existing Contributors have been changed to this role.</li><li>The Contributor role now is very similar to the Observer role, plus the ability to push new versions of the graph's schema. You can now mark individual variants as **protected**; you need to be a **Graph Admin** to push schemas to these variants.</li></ul> | <img width="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16724/105080845-406c9300-5a46-11eb-8c22-94122e4a5a93.png"> |

## 2021-01-12
| What's new |    |
| :--------- | -- |
| You can now hard delete organizations on your organization's **Settings** page. Previously, you needed to contact Apollo support to do this. When you hard delete an organization, the following things will happen:<ul><li>If your organization is on a Team plan or Team trial, your subscription willl be immediately canceled. We can't issue refunds for this unfortunately.</li><li>All users memberships in your organization will be removed. Users of your organization will maintain their user accounts, but they will no longer be members of your org.</li><li>All graphs in your organization will be hard deleted. To keep your data secure, their graph IDs will be tombstoned and you will not be able to create new graphs with the same ID in the future.</li></ul>| <img width="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/104364461-76040000-54cb-11eb-929f-7bf935128f39.png"> |

| You can now mock data from your operations in the Explorer with the "Mock responses" option in the Explorer's settings. This will return naively mocked data rather than sending requests to your endpoint. This is useful if you need to generate test data or if you want to try out queries without having and endpoint to send to. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5922187/97745141-a11eac00-1aa5-11eb-9a47-c9f8a2037ce2.png) |

| Building off of recent updates to schema checks, you can now rerun checks from inside Studio. When you rerun a check, the latest check configuration is applied. The new check uses an updated time window for operations ‚Äî in addition, any changes made to excluded / included clients, checked variants, and any operations already marked safe / ignored are incorporated when rerunning. If you are using the Github Action to trigger checks, a rerun of the check also updates the status of the check in Github. | ![Rerun Checks Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1831709/97130183-c30deb00-1794-11eb-8b03-a79818ac78db.png) |

## 2020-10-02
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| The [Datadog integration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/datadog-integration/) now sends metrics that start with `apollo.operations` instead of `apollo.engine.operations` and tags them with `graph:` rather than `service:`, to match our current naming scheme. This change affects newly configured Datadog integrations only. Graphs currently sending metrics to Datadog continue to use the old names; you can change to use the new names by clicking "Transition to modern mode" on your graph's Integrations page. |

## 2020-09-24
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| Federation: you can now see composition errors on implementing services published to your variant. You can see these composition errors, if present, by clicking on the "services" tab of the variant in question. |

## 2020-09-23
| What's new |
| :--------- |
| Creating new graphs with the Apollo Server integration is now simpler. Running your server with the `APOLLO_KEY` and
  `APOLLO_SCHEMA_REPORTING` environment variables will now automatically report metrics and schema to Studio, with no configuration in `ApolloServer` itself necessary. |

## 2020-09-16
- Studio welcomes a new and improved check details page, featuring...
  - Request usage graphs of affected operations
  - Differentiation between operations that are broken vs. changing behavior
  - One-click views of operation bodies, change details, and check configuration

| We'll make a best guess at reconstructing any unrecognized directives, so schemas that don't include definitions for directives should no longer crash the Schema or Explorer pages. | |
| Improved experience for path selection in Explorer page's search | |
| You can now favorite graph variants, which will pin the variant to the top of the graphs list page. Favorited variants are saved to your individual account, so you'll be able to see them when logging in on a new device. To favorite a graph, hover over your desired variant on the graph list page, and click the star icon on the left side. | ![favorite-graphs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8431868/91739780-64573700-eb80-11ea-8073-4d66d0f0c443.gif) |
