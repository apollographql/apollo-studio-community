## 2025-06-03 Operations Checks Bulk Actions
| What's new                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| :-: |
| You can now bulk ignore and mark operations as safe directly from the Operations Checks page. This makes it much faster and easier to handle large volumes of broken or potentially affected operations.   | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49476382-b1ae-4696-93e5-da6c13029a1b)

## 2025-04-24 New Operation Insights Errors page
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| The Insights > Errors page now lets you group and filter errors by underlying service and error code. See the [documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform/insights/errors) for more information and instructions on how to enable [extended error reporting](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform/insights/errors#extended-error-reporting).| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d018ea-bdbc-479d-9e1a-c07aab246536)

## 2025-03-26 Schema proposal checks now WARN on missing description changes instead of ERROR
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| Schema proposal checks now WARN instead of ERROR for descriptions that do not have a matching approved schema proposal. This means copy and white space mismatches in descriptions will no longer block these checks. | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1fdfba0-dfa7-4a6c-9049-d93e23f1e52c)


## 2025-02-05 Happy new year! 🥳
| What's new | |
| :--------- | :-: |
| Schema proposal checks now show more granular results when you open the matching proposals drawer for a given line. This makes it easier to identify which change is causing your check to fail and why. | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcbb659b-22b8-4840-8ae5-f03e890f8f9b)
