| **ðŸ““ Schema Checks in Launches have been removed.** Studio no longer supports Schema Checks as a part of Launches. We strongly recommend that users use rover and our full featured Checks offering to prevent Launches which will negatively impact your traffic, as this is the best way to control changes to your Supergraph. If you would like to see Checks and change management in Launches, please get ahold of your account rep, we'd love to hear from you! | |

| Based on popular request, Apollo Studio now supports [Operations Scripts](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/explorer/connecting-authenticating/#operation-scripts)! Operation scripts can be used for performing complex automations or for testing [sequence of operations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/explorer/connecting-authenticating#chaining-operations). This feature comes with powerful IntelliSense capability that you can use to find the exact graphref, collection and operation to use in the script! |![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86634858/218589899-e97f7eb2-2fb9-450c-9b2a-48fa1d5073f0.png)

| **Automatically hiding unreachable schema elements**, a contracts feature, is now available in Studio! Up until today, tagging schema elements was very inconvenient especially when there were schema elements like inputs and enums that were unreachable anyway. Now we provide an option to automatically hide those unreachable elements to create a more pleasant user experience, helping you build faster and more efficiently!   | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10705986/213568890-6b0543e1-6c88-45de-b480-52bf82c7ff5a.png)

## 2023-01-09 We now flatten objects in an array if they are all simple values in the object!
| What's new | **Table Mode** in Explorer will now collapse arrays of simple objects into individual columns in the table. This should make CSVs exported from Table Mode much more pleasant to work with. |
