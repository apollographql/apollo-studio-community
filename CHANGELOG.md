- The [Datadog integration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/datadog-integration/) now sends metrics that start with `apollo.operations` instead of `apollo.engine.operations` and tags them with `graph:` rather than `service:`, to match our current naming scheme. This change affects newly configured Datadog integrations only. Graphs currently sending metrics to Datadog continue to use the old names; you can change to use the new names by clicking "Transition to modern mode" on your graph's Integrations page.

## 2020-09-24
- Federation: you can now see composition errors on implementing services published to your variant. You can see these composition errors, if present, by clicking on the "services" tab of the variant in question.  

## 2020-09-23
- Creating new graphs with the Apollo Server integration is now simpler. Running your server with the `APOLLO_KEY` and
`APOLLO_SCHEMA_REPORTING` environment variables will now automatically report metrics and schema to Studio, with no configuration in `ApolloServer` itself necessary.

## 2020-09-16
- Studio welcomes a new and improved check details page, featuring...
  - Request usage graphs of affected operations
  - Differentiation between operations that are broken vs. changing behavior
  - One-click views of operation bodies, change details, and check configuration
  - A brand new visual feel
  - ... and more! We hope you enjoy

## 2020-09-08
- Explorer now supports subscriptions, you can set a separate subscription URL in the variant settings  

## 2020-09-01
- When setting the endpoint url to be used in explorer, you now have the option of configuring it to include cookies for all users.
- The history and checks pages in Studio now link to the commit you were on when you ran `service:push`/`service:check` for GitHub and Bitbucket users.

## 2020-08-31
- We'll make a best guess at reconstructing any unrecognized directives, so schemas that don't include definitions for directives should no longer crash the Schema or Explorer pages.
- Improved experience for path selection in Explorer page's search  
- You can now favorite graph variants, which will pin the variant to the top of the graphs list page.  
  Favorited variants are saved to your individual account, so you'll be able to see them when logging in on a new device.
  To favorite a graph, hover over your desired variant on the graph list page, and click the star icon on the left side:

## 2020-08-28
- You can now use [graphql-lodash](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-lodash) directives in studio to apply transformations to your results.
- "Cancel" button now added to Upload Schema modal in Schema tab.

## 2020-08-26
- User roles and permissions are now available in Studio by request ‚Äì‚Äì email support@apollographql.com if you're interested. Take a look at our [official documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/org/members) for the feature for a detailed breakdown on what permissions each role has.

## 2020-08-21
- üêõ Bug fix: SSO users should see their name and avatar in Studio now (provided they've set up the attribute mapping via PingOne)

## 2020-08-20
- üêõ Bug fix: schema checks no longer skip anonymous operations

## 2020-08-18

- "Type Browser" has been renamed to "Reference"

- Types and Fields that appear in Changelog now link to their place in Reference
- Reference is now searchable via `‚åò + K` (`Ctrl + K` for PC) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/743976/90545321-78e60900-e156-11ea-819d-df7374e6c494.png)


## 2020-08-05

New in general:

- You can now do a _one-time_ schema upload to Studio by introspecting a URL or pasting a schema to get started **much** more quickly.
- You can now do a one-time upload of your schema at any point by clicking the "Upload Schema" button on the Schema page.

## 2020-06-30 ‚Äì‚Äì¬†‚ú® New Page: Explorer ‚ú®

We have released the Explorer, available as a top-level page for graphs. The Explorer is a full-featured query building IDE that connects to the registry and can be configured uniquely for each of your variants.

Full details on the release in our announcement post: [Introducing the Apollo Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/introducing-the-apollo-explorer/).

## 2020-06-29

We have formally [renamed the product from Graph Manager to Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graph-manager-is-now-studio/), moved our URL from engine.apollographql.com to studio.apollographql.com, and have updated our website, docs, and in-product references to reflect the change.
