## What is Studio

Studio is your interface to browse the state of your graph, query your data, and manage the evolution of your graph over time. It is a pillar of the Apollo Platform, alongside [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/), and [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/).
#### Single source of truth for your GraphQL schema
- Registering your graph with Apollo Studio creates a cloud-hosted source of truth for your schema, giving you access to best-in-class tools for managing your data graph. 
- Studio automatically tracks and logs changes to your schema, so you can easily review and share how your graph has evolved.
- Keep graph collaborators and consumers up to date with notifications and an automatic changelog whenever your schema changes.
#### Explore your schema and build queries more easily and intelligently than ever before
- Studio’s Explorer offers the most advanced GraphQL IDE in the world. 
- Search your schema intelligently and build queries with one click.
- Use Explorer in Studio’s public sandbox to explore any graph with introspection enabled 
- Use Explorer with your registered graphs to create queries, browse your run history, and save variables in a context-aware environment without requiring introspection.

#### Deliver changes to your graph with speed and confidence
- Realize the full potential of an agile data graph with version control, change validation, and release observability purpose-built for GraphQL schemas.
- Prevent breaking changes to your schema by integrating Schema Checks into your existing CI/CD pipelines.
- Make changes to your schema on variants to work on new features, test performance, and run checks without changing your graph in production.
- Track federated schema launches in progress with real-time information on request traffic, gateways reporting, and error rate.

#### Secure your schema while maintaining flexibility and agility
- Apollo Studio offers granular controls to keep sensitive information in your graph secure.
- With a registered graph, you can turn introspection off for security purposes while still giving users in your organization get all of the benefits of Explorer.
- Set user roles at the organization and graph level to manage how different users can interact with your schemas.
- Mark variant schemas as protected to limit mutations to only certain users or keys with admin-level access.
